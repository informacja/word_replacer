Slow Compilation Speeds
In my mind this is a big one. And so I also want to share some tips to fix this.
Starting with a cargo new --bin and jumping into your editor, compilation speeds are great and editor feedback is fast. Add around five crates, and you're in the 5 seconds zone for compilation.
Fast forward to a medium to large project and youâ€™re looking at 30 seconds for a build and around 5 seconds for a cargo check, which is what my editor (and probably other editors) will use for quick error checking, which is supposed to be what sets the squigglies for your fast feedback loop.
